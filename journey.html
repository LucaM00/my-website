<h2>The Journey</h2>
<section class="content-section">
<h3>The Origin</h3>
<p>My education at Liceo Berchet, rooted in classical studies, was not a detour, but the genesis of my ability to discern the inherent "architecture" in complex systems. This skill, refined through the analysis of ancient texts and timeless philosophies, proved fundamental in my scientific journey, allowing me to apply a unique perspective to biology.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section">
<h3>The Turning Point</h3>
<p>The MEDTEC program represented the crucial moment when my humanistic and scientific interests began to formally synthesize into a coherent path. Here, I discovered how the rigorous logic of engineering could integrate with the profound understanding of life offered by medicine, creating a synergy that would define my future research.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section">
<h3>The Path of Exploration</h3>
<p>My research experiences have been distinct chapters of a deliberate journey aimed at forging a multidisciplinary toolkit. From mastering the "grammar" of gene editing at CSUN, to using CRISPR to map complex systems at Harvard, up to integrating computational modeling with wet-lab science at Stanford/IEO, each stage has enriched my ability to tackle biological challenges from different perspectives.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section">
<h3>The Grounding Force</h3>
<p>My field research in public health in Madagascar reinforced my "why," connecting my advanced research to tangible human needs and global health realities. This experience reminded me of the importance of applying scientific knowledge to generate a concrete and significant impact on people's lives.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section">
<h3>The Vision Forward</h3>
<p>These integrated experiences have solidified my mission: to build new frameworks for understanding and solving complex biological problems. My path is now firmly oriented towards the horizon, where future aspirations will materialize into innovative solutions for the benefit of society and clinics.</p>
