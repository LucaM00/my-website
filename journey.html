            <section class="content-section">
                <h3>The Origin</h3>
                <p>My path began not in a lab, but in the study of ancient languages and philosophy at Liceo Berchet. There, I learned to see the world through the lens of structureâ€”to find the hidden architecture in texts, arguments, and human history. That foundation taught me that to build anything new, you must first understand its deepest patterns.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h3>The Collision of Worlds</h3>
                <p>The MEDTEC program was the crucible where my two worlds collided. It was here that the rigorous, systemic logic of engineering met the profound, organic complexity of medicine. I realized that the future of human health would not be found in one field, but in the disciplined, creative synthesis of both.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h3>The Path of Exploration</h3>
                <p>My research experiences have been distinct chapters of a deliberate journey aimed at forging a multidisciplinary toolkit. From mastering the "grammar" of gene editing at CSUN, to using CRISPR to map complex systems at Harvard, up to integrating computational modeling with wet-lab science at Stanford/IEO, each stage has enriched my ability to tackle biological challenges from different perspectives.</p>

                <h3>The Grounding Force</h3>
                <p>My field research in public health in Madagascar reinforced my "why," connecting my advanced research to tangible human needs and global health realities. This experience reminded me of the importance of applying scientific knowledge to generate a concrete and significant impact on people's lives.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h3>The Vision Forward</h3>
                <p>These integrated experiences have solidified my mission: to build new frameworks for understanding and solving complex biological problems. My path is now firmly oriented towards the horizon, where future aspirations will materialize into innovative solutions for the benefit of society and clinics.</p>
