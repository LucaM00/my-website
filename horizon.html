                <h3>The Confluence</h3>
                <p>We are at a unique historical moment where the ability to read and write biology through genomics and synthetic biology is converging with our ability to understand complexity through artificial intelligence and machine learning. This confluence represents an unprecedented opportunity to redefine the boundaries of medicine and biotechnology.</p>

                <h3>The Next Architecture of Biology</h3>
                <p>This convergence allows us to envision and achieve concrete, visionary goals: "programmable medicines" that act as dynamic circuits within the human body, AI-designed biological systems that transcend what evolution has produced, and personalized therapies that adapt in real-time to patient needs. We are building a new architecture of biology, where rational design meets natural complexity.</p>

                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>My goal is to be one of the architects who responsibly and ethically builds these new systems, always with a focus on societal and clinical benefit. Through the integration of diverse disciplines and the application of innovative methodologies, I aspire to contribute to the creation of solutions that not only advance scientific knowledge but also concretely improve human life.</p>
